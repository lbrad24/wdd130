                    <h2>Hambouer</h2>
                    <p>Hambouer is a Male Dwarf Ranger, he is strong and dexterous, but not very good with words. Hambouer joined a chaotic band of adventurers with varying morals but coming together with the promise of gold. 
                        Hambouer is highly motivated by food, and is easily distracted by the smell of food. Hambouer is very proficient with travel both above and below ground, he is comfortable scaling mountains, 
                        and moving quietly through the forest. His favorite weapon is an axe, which he wields as both a tool and a weapon.</p>

                    <h2>Melee</h2>
                    <p>Once the adventurers were in the wilderness of Barovia the companions took things slow, not knowing where to go or what to do, but surrounded by the wilderness where Hambouer felt at home, he took some time by himself. 
                        While immersing himself in the sounds of the forest, Hambouer found himself face to face with a badger. Hambouer pulled out some of the food from his pack and offered it to the badger, and soon he and the badger had formed a connection. 
                        Hambouer named the badger melee, and took him back to camp. Melee is a close companion who stays by Hambouerâ€™s side and helps him in battle, using claws and teeth, while Hambouer swings his axe.</p>
