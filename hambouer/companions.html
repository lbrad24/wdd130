Uses his songs to invigorate his companions to make their attacks stronger, while using insults and jeers to hurt the enemies with words.</p>

                    <h2>Sir Aulfric - Noble Knight</h2>
                    <p>Sir Aulfric, a late addition to the band after they had spent some time in Barovia, with a common goal, but very different morals. While the other companions love chaos, he is good at heart and unflinching in his values, often at conflict with the rest of the band. While allying himself with the companions, he is really searching for his friends from whom he was separated when he entered Barovia.</p>
