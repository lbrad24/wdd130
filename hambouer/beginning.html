                    <h2>The Companions meet at an Inn</h2>
                    <p>The adventurers all meet at an inn, summoned by a mysterious person willing to pay well for them to retrieve something from what looks like an abandoned house on the edge of town. 
                    After the meeting the group splits, and Hambouer and Cassius watch the house for any signs of inhabitants, while Sprodine and Alzomorph have some fun robbing a local shop of any valuables they can.
                    Quickly the companions' personalities are exposed, some good, some evil, and all of them chaotic to the core.</p>

                    <h2>The Abandoned House</h2>
                    <p>After they met and entered the abandoned house they began to explore. A mist formed outside the house and they were no longer able to leave. 
                    Soon a suit of bewitched armor came to life and began to attack the group. Hambouer took a position at the front, taking hits while dealing a good amount himself, while the rest of the group joined in. 
                    They continued to explore into the upper floors, finding a deed to a windmill, some scrolls, and various different items. While searching they entered a closet and a broom came to life and whacked one of the companions, 
                    Hambouer stepped in and was nearly killed in one hit from the broom. The others managed to pull him back out and close the door, and with some rest Hambouer recovered, but was left with a fear of brooms. 
                    There were paintings of a family throughout the house, and skeletons in different rooms.</p>

                    <h2>The Cultist's in the secret basement</h2>
                    <p>After more searching the adventurers found a secret winding staircase down to the basement, hidden in the third-floor master bedroom. 
                    Inside the basement there were signs of life, with cultists, in various passageways. After working their way through the cultists, they came upon a room with ghosts inside that were not able to be harmed. 
                    After entering the room, a monstrous beast, a shambling mass took shape and began to pursue them, the adventurers fled and as they entered the third floor again the house had come to life, with more traps and awakened objects. 
                    So Hambouer had a simple conclusion, instead of running through a house while being pursued, instead he could simply attach a rope to the balcony in the room nearby, and climb down the outside.</p>

                    <h2>The Companions Enter Barovia</h2>
                    <p>When they escaped, they realized they were no longer at the edge of town, but in an entirely different land. Somehow, they had been transported to a land called Barovia. 
                    There were other various adventures, of fighting wolves, a mysterious Lord of the land of Barovia named Strahd, and a cloud of evil hanging over everyone. 
                    Once the adventurers were in the wilderness of Barovia they took things slow, not knowing where to go or what to do, but surrounded by the wilderness where Hambouer felt at home, he took some time by himself. 
                    While immersing himself in the sounds of the forest, Hambouer found himself face to face with a badger. Hambouer pulled out some of the food from his pack and offered it to the badger, and soon he and the badger had formed a connection. 
                    Hambouer named the badger melee, and took him back to camp. The adventurers were soon on their way again, and suddenly they heard howls. 
                    They were soon surrounded by a pack of six wolves, and the alpha seemed to be different, smarter, somehow. The wolves began their attack, and Hambouer pulled out his battle axe with Melee at his side. 
                    The group began to take the wolves down, one by one, in one case Hambouer dealt a great blow to a wolf, which was then finished off by a quick maul from Melee. After most of the wolves had died, the alpha transformed into a man. 
                    He was both handsome and terrifying, and he introduced himself as Strahd. Strahd was the ruler of Barovia, and he held it under a dark grasp where everyone was afraid of his power. Strahd commended the companions on their fighting, 
                    but warned them they would not make it out alive, and they were just his playthings. Then Strahd vanished, and the companions had a clear goal, find a way to defeat Strahd and leave the land of Barovia.</p>
